##Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
#Purpose

#The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit:

#a tidy data set as described below;
#a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis; and
#a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md.
#You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

##Objectives

#The run_analysis.R script performs the following:

#1.  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
#2.  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
#3.  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
#4.  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
#5.  Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

#run_analysis.R

#It sets the working directrory to the same location with the working files.
#It loads the train and test data sets and combineds them into one data frame. This is done using rbind.
#It extracts just the mean and standard deviation from the features combined data set. This is done using grep.
#After cleaning the column names, these are applied to the combined data frame.
#After loading activities data set, it converts it to lower case using tolower and removes underscore using gsub function and subject column names are named for the combinedLabel and combinedSubject data sets.
#The three data sets then are merged. 
#A the combined file is saved as a txt file into the same working directory, named combined.txt.
#The mean of activities and subjects are created into a separate tidy data set which is exported into the same working directory and is named average.txt.
